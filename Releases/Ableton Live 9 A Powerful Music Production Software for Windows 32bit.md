- **Session View and Arrangement View:** Ableton Live 9 lets you work in two different views: Session View and Arrangement View. Session View is where you can improvise and experiment with musical ideas, while Arrangement View is where you can record and edit your tracks in a traditional linear way. You can switch between the two views at any time and even drag and drop clips from one to another.
- **Audio and MIDI editing:** Ableton Live 9 gives you powerful tools to edit your audio and MIDI clips. You can warp, transpose, crop, reverse, split, consolidate, and quantize your audio clips with ease. You can also edit your MIDI clips with the piano roll, drum rack, or step sequencer. You can also use automation and modulation to add movement and expression to your tracks.
- **Sample slicing:** Ableton Live 9.7 introduced more sample slicing options for users who want to chop up their audio samples and create new rhythms and melodies. You can slice by beat division, region, transient, or manually. You can also choose from different slicing presets or create your own.
- **Drum layout:** Ableton Live 9.7 also added a new drum layout for users who want to play drums on their Push controller. The new layout lets you access up to 16 drum sounds per pad and switch between them with the touch strip. You can also adjust the velocity, swing, and repeat settings on the fly.
- **On-screen display improvements:** Ableton Live 9.7 also improved the on-screen display for Push users who want to see more information on their computer screen while working with the hardware. The new display shows the device parameters, clip names, track names, and more.
- **Audio and MIDI routing:** Ableton Live 9.7 also enabled audio and MIDI routing from Push. This means you can now send audio or MIDI from Push to any track in Live without touching your mouse or keyboard. You can also use external instruments and effects with Push.
